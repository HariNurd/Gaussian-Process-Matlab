# Predicting Hotspot Numbers in Kalimantan Using Gaussian Process Regression
This repository contains the implementation of a model to predict the number of hotspots in Kalimantan, Indonesia, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based on climate indicators. The research was conducted as part of a thesis at the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Institut Pertanian Bogor.

## Overview

Forest fires in Kalimantan are a recurring natural disaster influenced heavily by both local and global climate indicators. This project develops a predictive model with low hyperparameter complexity, leveraging the Gaussian Process Regression method to estimate the number of hotspots based on various climate indicators.

### The key objectives of this study are:

- To construct a Gaussian Process Regression model using climate data such as rainfall, days without rain, and global climate indicators like El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD).
- To optimize the model using three hyperparameter tuning methods: Bayesian optimization, grid search, and random search.

### Key Features

- Data: The model uses data collected from various sources, including local climate data (rainfall, rainfall anomaly, days without rain) and global climate indicators (ENSO, IOD).
- Modeling: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) is used to model the relationship between climate indicators and the number of hotspots.
- Kernel Functions: The ARD Squared Exponential kernel is primarily used due to its ability to handle different scales of input features effectively.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: The model's performance is optimized using Bayesian optimization, grid search, and random search techniques, ensuring the best fit for both training and testing datasets.

### Results

The best-performing model was achieved using Bayesian optimization and random search for hyperparameter tuning. The model achieved the following accuracy metrics on the test set:

Bayesian optimization
- RMSE: 844.47
- MAE: 354.29
- R-squared: 54.52%

random search
- RMSE: 846.58
- MAE: 350.93
- R-squared: 54.29%

These results indicate a good fit for predicting the number of hotspots based on the climate indicators provided.
